  When enabled, regular users will be able to change the configuration of jobs that use this strategy.
  This may open up a security risk as the users could potentially configure the job to run scripts
  which would enable an escalation of privileges attack.
  <br />
  When disabled, only users with the <code>RUN_SCRIPTS</code> permission will be able to either select
  this strategy or reconfigure a job that uses this strategy.
  <br />
  <strong>NOTE:</strong> The RUN_SCRIPTS permission is the highest permission available in Jenkins.
  By default, all administrator users will have the RUN_SCRIPTS permission.

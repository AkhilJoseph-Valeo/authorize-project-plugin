Do not require authentication in the <strong>next</strong> configuration if the User ID is not changed.
Use this feature carefully, for a malicious user can run unintended commands without authentication by changing configuration of the project.
You should also watch CONFIGURE privilege for this project is granted only to proper users.

This does not work when configuring via REST/CLI.
